This project implements a delicious like Social Bookmarking Learning activity Module for the LMS **Moodle**.

Most of you will know del.icio.us and Iâ€™m sure that some of you are using this service. So installing this module in your Moodle, you would be able to create mini-delicious activities inside your courses to do some kind of **WebQuest**.

The main idea is that students search information about a topic using the World Wide Web and share whatever they find with their partners. Using this tool, links can be tagged and organized easily.

**moodle-social-bookmarking** is a project iniciated by Jordi Piguillem and Ludo(Marc Alier) at the GESSI research group at [UPC](http://www.upc.edu).

See a [http://www.dfwikilabs.org/course/view.php?id=4demo of Social Bookmarking for Moodle.

The project works fine for Moodle 1.9 and hopefully soon will be a version for Moodle 2.0, once this is up and about.
